Introduction
The digital revolution has revolutionized the music industry, providing access to a vast collection of songs across different genres and artists. However, navigating through this extensive library can be overwhelming. The songs clustering approach helps organize songs by categorizing them based on their musical features, leading to a more streamlined music discovery process.

This project focuses on applying K-means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN clustering algorithms to a dataset of Spotify songs. By leveraging Spotify's API, we extract audio features such as danceability, energy, instrumentalness, and tempo, among others, to capture the underlying similarities and differences between songs.

Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/songs-clustering-project.git
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Explore the code and data in the repository.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of Spotify songs and their corresponding audio features. These features include danceability, energy, instrumentalness, tempo, and more. The dataset allows for a comprehensive analysis of songs and serves as the foundation for clustering.

Clustering Algorithms
This project utilizes the following clustering algorithms:

K-means Clustering: This algorithm partitions data into distinct groups by minimizing the sum of squared distances between each song and the centroid of its assigned cluster. The number of clusters can be adjusted to explore different levels of song categorization.

Hierarchical Clustering: Unlike K-means, hierarchical clustering builds a tree-like structure of clusters, enabling flexible exploration of song similarities. Clusters are merged or split based on a distance or similarity metric, creating a hierarchical representation of songs.

DBSCAN: DBSCAN identifies dense regions of data points and groups them together, classifying low-density regions as noise. This algorithm is effective for datasets with varying cluster shapes and densities.

Evaluation
The quality of the song clusters will be evaluated using internal and external validation measures. Internal validation measures include the silhouette coefficient, which assesses the compactness and separation of clusters. External validation measures can involve comparing the clusters with genre labels, if available, to determine the effectiveness of the clustering algorithms.

Results
The clustering results will be visualized using scatter plots, dendrograms, and heatmaps to provide a clear understanding of the song categorization. The visualizations will help identify patterns, outliers, and relationships between different clusters.

Usage
Detailed instructions on how to run the clustering algorithms and explore the results can be found in the Usage document.
